# File Content Modifier

## Description
This Python program reads the content of a user-specified text file, modifies the content by converting all characters to uppercase, and writes the modified content into a new file. The new file is named by prefixing the original filename with "modified_".

## Features
- Prompts the user to enter the filename of the input file.
- Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist or cannot be read.
- Performs a simple modification on the file content (uppercase conversion), demonstrating file reading and writing.
- Saves the modified content in a new file with a distinctive filename.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python program.
2. When prompted, enter the filename of the text file you want to modify.
3. If the file exists and is readable, the program will create a new file named `modified_<original_filename>` containing the uppercase content.
4. If the file does not exist or cannot be read, an error message will be displayed.

## Example
```
Enter the filename to read: example.txt
Modified content written to modified_example.txt
```

## Error Handling
- Alerts the user if the input file does not exist.
- Alerts the user if the input file cannot be read due to permission issues or other I/O errors.
- Handles unexpected errors gracefully and displays an appropriate message.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
